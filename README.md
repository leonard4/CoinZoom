CoinZoom
==========

This project was an exercise to create a common mechanic you see in mobile and PC games where a coin or powerup spawns, and once clicked it bursts into a smaller group and flys off towards a counter.

In this project we use a coin, once you click it, the primary coin is destroyed and a burst of smaller coins is spawned where the old object was and then they zoom off towards the coin counter on screen and disappear once they get added. Right now each master coin has a value assigned and then randomly has 0-19 added, then that value is used to spawn the smaller coins. 

You can right click anywhere to spawn a new coin, and then left click to collect it.
