CoinZoom
==========

This project was an exercise to create a common mechanic you see in mobile and PC games where a coin or powerup spawns. In this instance we use a coin, once you click it, the primary coin is destroyed and a burst of smaller coins is spawned where the old object was and then they zoom off towards the coin counter on screen and disappear once they get added.
